Spacedust theme for Terminal.app
================================

This is a Mac OS X Terminal.app color scheme based on the excellent [Spacedust Xcode theme](http://simplyhacking.com/spacedust-xcode-theme-for-xcode-4.html). If you use the Xcode theme, this will give you a more consistent experience between Xcode and Terminal.

How to use
----------

1. Download `Spacedust.terminal`.
2. Under the "Shell" menu, select "Import..." and open the theme file.
3. Set this theme as the default in Terminal's preferences (optional).

Enjoy!
